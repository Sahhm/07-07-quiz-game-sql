# 2. Alternative Javascript Quiz Game

<p>Re-implement (as a new project) your Javascript quiz game. This time, load all of the questions onto the page ahead of time â€“ but hide all of them except the first question.

When the user submits an answer, the result should show as it did for your previous version of this application. And when they click 'Next', the next question should show up. The difference this time is that you're not loading the new question from a Javascript array. Rather, you're hiding the current question's div and showing the next question's div.
